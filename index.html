      <h2>From raw curiosity to engineered intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        I never waited for perfect timing or perfect resources. I built my lane by taking on systems that looked complex from the outside and making them predictable from the inside. Every constraint became fuel. Every failure became data. Every challenge turned into a sharper execution loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        My path across <strong>autonomous robotics, AI security, adversarial machine learning, and systems engineering</strong> is driven by a simple rule:
        if a system exists, its risks can be mapped; if its risks can be mapped, it can be secured; and once it is secured, it can scale with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I focus on engineering <strong>trustworthy AI</strong>, strengthening <strong>dialogue-level defenses for LLMs</strong>, and designing <strong>semi-autonomous robotic platforms</strong> that stay stable, observable, and useful in the real world — not just in a lab demo.

      <h2>Research direction</h2>
      <p>
        My research sits at the intersection of <strong>AI safety, cybersecurity, and human-machine interaction</strong>.
        I study how language models behave under adversarial influence and how trust, misuse, over-reliance, and hidden vulnerabilities emerge in natural conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I design frameworks that predict, measure, and mitigate failures at the dialogue level — aligning technical safeguards with human behavior so AI systems stay reliable under pressure, ambiguity, and targeted manipulation.

        <h2>The operator behind the systems</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up reverse-engineering whatever landed in my hands — not for grades or trophies, but to understand the invisible logic that makes systems behave. That instinct turned into building drones from scratch, debugging sensors at 3&nbsp;a.m., and hardening AI models against the kind of edge cases most people don’t see coming.

        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently based in Miami, pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Florida International University,
          and sharpening a long-term track in <strong>AI security, robotics, and high-leverage systems design</strong>.
          Outside research and engineering, I build aquascapes, design systems for my own life, and stay obsessed with long-term compounding — in skills, in relationships, and in impact.

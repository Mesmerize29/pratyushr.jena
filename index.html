              <p>
                This work started as a simple concern. Most LLM security talk felt like a list
                of party tricks. Prompt this, block that. Nothing about how the whole system
                behaves over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I reframed it as an interaction chain. Inputs, internal processing, outputs.
                At each stage I mapped failure patterns, attacks, and what a realistic defense
                would look like if it had to live inside a product.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result is an interaction centric taxonomy and a layered defense pipeline,
                structured as an IEEE style review and a blueprint for future tools.

                On paper, the hexacopter is a hardware project. In practice it is a computer
                science problem. Modes, states, transitions, and what happens when the world
                acts like a bug report.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using Navio2, LiDAR, TF Mini, and Mission Planner I worked on how the system
                should react when ranges drop, wind changes, or telemetry lies. The goal was
                not just to fly but to stay explainable.
              </p>
              <p>
                It forced me to express behavior as clear states and transitions and to use
                telemetry and logs as first class tools for debugging reality.

                In labs, nothing is perfectly aligned. Lighting shifts, holders move, caps are
                missing. I built a RealSense based system that accepts this instead of fighting
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system detects cap colors, segments vials into four holders, and creates a
                clean map for a future robot. Black caps, missing caps, and empty spots are
                handled in one consistent way so the controller does not have to guess.

                The real win is the interface. A bridge between noisy pixels and simple data

              </p>

                Think of it as an AI assisted ecosystem. Sensors, agents, and models working to

                systems lab.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of my current work points toward this. LLM safety, robotics, and
                nature inspired computation are all training grounds for that longer horizon.

              I look at how information enters, moves, and leaves. Every stage can amplify or

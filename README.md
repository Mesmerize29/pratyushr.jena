## **About Me**
I did not follow a straight path. Nothing in my journey was pre-scripted or inherited. I built my skillset the same way I build systems: from the ground up, through pressure, curiosity, and the need to make things work.

I operate at the intersection of AI security, robotics, and systems engineering.  
I build machines that think, models that defend themselves, and systems that stay stable under real-world stress.

If a system exists, I map its risks.  
If its risks can be mapped, I secure it.  
If it can be secured, I scale it with confidence.

Everything else is noise.

## **Research Direction**
My research sits at the intersection of AI safety, cybersecurity, and human-machine interaction.  
I study how language models behave under adversarial influence and how trust, misuse, and over-reliance appear in conversation.

I build frameworks that:
- Predict failures  
- Measure reliability  
- Mitigate dialogue-level risks  
- Align system safeguards with real human behavior  

I am preparing for a PhD with a focus on AI security, robotics, and integrated system reliability.

## **About Me**
I don’t come from a straight line. Nothing in my journey has been pre-scripted, inherited, or handed down. I built my skillset the same way I build systems — from the ground up, under pressure, through necessity, curiosity, and an impatience to make things *work*.

I operate where **AI security**, **robotics**, and **systems engineering** intersect.  
I design machines that think, models that defend themselves, and systems that hold their shape when reality becomes adversarial.

I don’t chase complexity for aesthetics — I chase execution.  
If a system exists, I map its risks.  
If its risks can be mapped, I secure it.  
If it can be secured, I scale it.

Everything else is noise.
